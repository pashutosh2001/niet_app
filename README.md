## College Management Application.

This project is about college management application which is designed to get all college records on your fingertips.

It consists of two separate applications, one for students - where they can go through their academic details and get all study materials easily and the other app for admin such as Professors, Head of Departments and the adminstrative staff. In the admin app, admins can provide notices, study materials and also can update and add attendance marks and dues of students.
